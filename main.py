Hangman
Code will pick a random word from a list of words, then present user with blanks for each letter, and a text drawing of a classic hangman. User will enter a single letter, and if it matches, blanks will replace with correct letter in correct places. if it does not, wrong letter will appear along with updated drawing, when drawing completes (6 wrong guesses), code displays full drawing and you lose. if all blanks are filled, code displays full word and you win.
